Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, 
especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. 
Applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and machine vision.

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to automatically learn and improve from experience 
without being explicitly programmed. ML focuses on the development of algorithms that can analyze data, identify patterns, 
and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Deep learning, a subset of ML, uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to analyze various 
factors of data. Deep learning has driven many AI innovations such as image recognition, autonomous vehicles, and chatbots.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using 
natural language. The ultimate goal of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of human languages in a valuable way.

AI is transforming industries by automating complex processes, improving decision-making, and enhancing user experiences. 
However, it also raises ethical concerns such as privacy, bias, and job displacement, which require careful consideration.
